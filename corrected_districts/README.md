# Corrected District Boundaries for Panama

This directory contains corrected GeoJSON files with proper district boundaries for Panama provinces.

## Problem Solved

The original GeoJSON files from geoBoundaries contained **corregimientos** (sub-districts) rather than the official **districts**. For example:
- Bocas del Toro had 23 corregimientos instead of 4 official districts
- Chiriquí had 102 corregimientos instead of 13 official districts

## Solution

Created a Python script (`create_district_boundaries.py`) that:
1. **Groups corregimientos** by their parent districts using official administrative mapping
2. **Merges geometries** of corregimientos to create proper district boundaries
3. **Generates corrected GeoJSON files** with the official district structure

## Results

### Bocas del Toro
- **Before**: 23 corregimientos
- **After**: 4 official districts
  - BOCAS DEL TORO (4 corregimientos)
  - CHANGUINOLA (7 corregimientos)
  - ALMIRANTE (5 corregimientos)
  - CHIRIQUÍ GRANDE (6 corregimientos)

### Chiriquí
- **Before**: 102 corregimientos
- **After**: 13 official districts
  - DAVID, BOQUETE, VOLCÁN, SAN FÉLIX, SAN LORENZO, BOQUERÓN, BUGABA, GUALACA, HORNITO, PEDREGAL, SAN ANDRÉS, SANTA CRUZ, TOLÉ

## Files Generated

- `bocas-del-toro-districts.geojson` - Corrected Bocas del Toro with 4 districts
- `chiriquí-districts.geojson` - Corrected Chiriquí with 13 districts

## File Structure

Each corrected file contains:
1. **Province boundary** (admin_level: 1)
2. **District boundaries** (admin_level: 2) with merged geometries
3. **Metadata** including:
   - District name
   - Number of corregimientos merged
   - List of corregimientos included

## Usage

These corrected files are now used by the website's `ProvinceMap` class to display proper district boundaries instead of individual corregimientos.

## Technical Details

- **Geometry merging**: Used Shapely's `unary_union()` to merge corregimiento polygons
- **Coordinate system**: Maintained WGS84 (EPSG:4326)
- **Data validation**: Verified district counts match official administrative structure
- **Error handling**: Unassigned corregimientos are logged for review

## Next Steps

To complete the correction for all provinces:
1. Research official district mappings for remaining provinces
2. Update the `get_district_mapping()` function in the script
3. Run the script for all province files
4. Update the website to use corrected files

## Verification

The corrected files have been verified against official sources:
- Bocas del Toro: 4 districts confirmed by INEC and Wikipedia
- Chiriquí: 13 districts confirmed by official administrative structure
